# APCSA-Company-Project
A project done by Aiden Chen, Pranav Sreeram, Vincent Xiao, Ryan Liu, and Sammith Belur. 
This app serves as a platform for new students in a school or college to navigate through the area. 
We initialized this by making it for our high school, Mission San Jose High School. 

We hope you enjoy using Mission Map!
